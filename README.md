# Programming Resources

Programming resources for different languages, useful for learning new abilities or review your current knowledge. 

This repository was created to provide materials to students that wanted to enhance their programming and software creation skills of my former programming course "**_Tecnologias y Paradigmas de la Programaci√≥n_**", thaugh in the _Bachelor of Software Engineering_ of the _Scool of Computer Engineering_, University of Oviedo (https://ingenieriainformatica.uniovi.es/infoacademica/grado) 

**For better structure and classification, all the content have been moved to the repo Wiki: https://github.com/jose-r-lopez/Programming-Resources/wiki**
