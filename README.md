# Programming and Documentation Resources for my Final Degree Work students

Programming resources for different languages, useful for learning new abilities or review your current knowledge. 

This repository was created to provide materials to students that wanted to enhance their programming and software creation skills of my former programming course "**_Tecnologias y Paradigmas de la Programaci√≥n_**", 
thaugth in the _Bachelor of Software Engineering_ of the _Scool of Computer Engineering_, University of Oviedo (https://ingenieriainformatica.uniovi.es/infoacademica/grado). 

Since I am no longer teaching programming courses, I have repurposed this repository to help my **_Final Degree Project_** students to have curated materials to develop their works 

This repository deals with software construction tools and techniques. For security-focused content (including software security) please check my **Security materials repository** at https://github.com/jose-r-lopez/SSI_Extra_Materials. For infrastructure construction techniques (focused on IaC), please check my **Infrastructure automation repository** at https://github.com/jose-r-lopez/SSI_Infraestructure_Automation_Materials.

**For better structure and classification, all the content have been moved to the repo Wiki: https://github.com/jose-r-lopez/Programming-Resources/wiki**
